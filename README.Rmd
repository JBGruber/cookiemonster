The goal of `cookiemonster` is to make it easy to work with browser cookies in R.
Browser cookies are a way for browsers to recognise a user and their settings throughout sessions (e.g., if you accept a site's terms of service, this acceptance is saved as a cookie).
The focus of `cookiemonster` lies on making it possible to use these cookies from `R`to make request to the site (e.g., for web-scraping or automation).
If you are looking for a way to use cookies in shiny apps you can check out the [cookies pacakge](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cookies/index.html).


## Installation

You can install the development version of `cookiemonster` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JBGruber/cookiemonster")
```
