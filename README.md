The goal of `cookiemonster` is to make it easy to work with browser
cookies in R. Browser cookies are a way for browsers to recognise a user
and their settings throughout sessions (e.g., if you accept a siteâ€™s
terms of service, this acceptance is saved as a cookie). The focus of
`cookiemonster` lies on making it possible to use these cookies from
`R`to make request to the site (e.g., for web-scraping or automation).
If you are looking for a way to use cookies in shiny apps you can check
out the [cookies
pacakge](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cookies/index.html).
