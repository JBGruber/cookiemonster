# New submission: Package was archived on CRAN

I apologize, I did not notice that one issue was still remaining and somehow also missed the email. Only when the package was archived did I notice. 

## Test environment

* devtools::check(cran = TRUE) # locally on Arch Linux Desktop (AMD Ryzen AI Max 300 Series)
* devtools::check(remote = TRUE, manual = TRUE)
* devtools::check_win_devel()
* rhub::rhub_check(platforms = c("linux", "m1-san", "macos", "macos-arm64", "windows", "ubuntu-next", "ubuntu-release"))


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 1 warnings | 0 notes

*New submission due to archival on CRAN
